# Multimedia-fugacity-models-Level1
Level 1 model for the Environmental Chemistry course at the University of Amsterdam.

A Level I simulation is designed to model, in a simple first-step way, the repartition of a chemical component on different environmental mediums. 

The system is there considered as:</br>
- A closed environmental system </br>
- A constant amount of chemicals present in the system </br>
- System is in equilibrium </br>
- Only considers thermodynamic drivers of fate (equilibrium partitioning) of a fixed quantity of conserved (ie. non-reacting) chemical </br>
